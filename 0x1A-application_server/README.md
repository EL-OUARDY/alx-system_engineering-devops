## Overview
An application server is a software framework that provides an environment where applications can run, regardless of what the applications are or what they do. It serves business logic to application programs through various protocols and manages resources, including security, transaction processing, and messaging.

## Key Features
**Middleware Services:** Connects and integrates multiple systems, providing a robust infrastructure for applications.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensures that all parts of a transaction are completed successfully before saving changes, maintaining data integrity.
- **Security**: Offers authentication, authorization, and encryption services to secure applications and data.
- **Scalability**: Supports horizontal and vertical scaling to handle increasing loads and maintain performance.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions, allowing users to maintain state across multiple requests.
- **Resource Management**: Manages server resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth to optimize application performance.

## Popular Application Servers
- **Apache Tomcat**: An open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, and Java Expression Language technologies.
- **Gunicorn**: A Python WSGI HTTP server for UNIX, commonly used to deploy Python web applications.

## Typical Use Cases
- **Web Applications**: Running dynamic web applications that require server-side processing.
- **API Services**: Hosting RESTful or SOAP web services to provide APIs for client applications.
- **Enterprise Applications**: Supporting large-scale business applications that require robust transaction management and integration capabilities.
