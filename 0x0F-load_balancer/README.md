## What is a Load Balancer?
A load balancer is like a traffic cop for your web traffic. It distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed, thus improving the overall performance and reliability of your application.

## How does it work?
Imagine you have a popular website that receives thousands of requests per second. Instead of sending all those requests to a single server, a load balancer sits in front of multiple servers and distributes the incoming traffic evenly among them.

## Benefits of using a Load Balancer:
- **Improved Performance**: By distributing traffic evenly, a load balancer prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck, which can lead to faster response times for users.
- **High Availability**: If one server goes down, the load balancer can redirect traffic to the remaining servers, ensuring that your website stays up and running.
- **Scalability**: As your website grows, you can easily add more servers behind the load balancer to handle increased traffic.
- **Security**: Load balancers can help protect against certain types of cyber attacks, such as *DDoS* attacks, by filtering and monitoring incoming traffic.
