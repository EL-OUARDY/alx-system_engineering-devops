## OSI Model
- **What it is:** The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a framework defining how devices communicate over a network.
- **Layers:** It consists of 7 layers, each handling specific tasks, from physical connections to application-level data.

## LAN (Local Area Network)
- **What it is:** A LAN connects devices in a limited area like a home, office, or school.
- **Usage:** Sharing files, printers, or playing multiplayer games.
- **Size:** Typically covers a small geographical area like a single building.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)
- **What it is:** WAN links devices over a large geographical area, like cities or countries.
- **Usage:** Connecting offices across different cities, internet connectivity.
- **Size:** Spans vast distances compared to LANs.

## Internet
- **Overview:** The Internet is a global network connecting millions of devices worldwide.
- **IP Address:** A unique identifier for devices on a network.
- **Types of IP:** IPv4 (older) and IPv6 (newer, with more addresses).
- **Localhost:** Refers to your own device; often denoted by IP address 127.0.0.1.

## Subnet and IPv6
- **Subnet:** Divides networks into smaller sections for better management and security.
- **IPv6 Creation:** Developed due to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.

## TCP/UDP
- **Data Transfer Protocols:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- **Difference:** TCP ensures data delivery and order, while UDP is faster but may not guarantee delivery.
- **Port:** A virtual endpoint for communication within a device.
- **Ports:** SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443).
- **Network Check:** Ping is often used to check device connectivity on a network.
