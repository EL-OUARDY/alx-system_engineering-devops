## localhost/127.0.0.1?
- **localhost** or **127.0.0.1** is like a special nickname for your own computer. It's how your computer talks to itself. When you visit "localhost" or use "127.0.0.1" as an address, you're talking to your own machine.

## What is 0.0.0.0?
- **0.0.0.0** is a special IP address that means "any address" or "all addresses." When a server is set to listen on 0.0.0.0, it's willing to accept connections from any IP address.

## What is /etc/hosts?
- **/etc/hosts** is like a personal address book for your computer. It maps hostnames to IP addresses. You can add custom mappings here to control how your computer connects to specific websites or services.

## Display the machine’s active network interfaces?
- **ifconfig** is a command-line tool that shows your active network interfaces. It gives you info like your IP address, MAC address, and other network-related details.

## What are telnet, nc, and cut?
- **telnet** is a tool that lets you communicate with other computers over a network. It's like dialing a phone number to talk to another computer.
- **nc (netcat)** is a versatile networking utility that can read and write data across networks using TCP or UDP. It's like a Swiss Army knife for networking.
- **cut** is a command that lets you slice and dice text. In the networking context, it's often used to extract specific fields from the output of other commands for easier reading or processing.
